### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: Download from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: Download from [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run:

   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/ONtio-js/assesment.git)
   ```


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   After cloning, move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd assesment
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, if you’re using `yarn`:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or, if using `yarn`:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Access the Project**

   Once the server is running, you should see output similar to:

   ```bash
   VITE vX.X.X  ready in XX ms

   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ➜  Network: use `--host` to expose
   ```

   Open a browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the project.

6. **Build the Project for Production**

   To build the project for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or, with `yarn`:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production files.

7. **Preview the Production Build**

   You can preview the production build with:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   or, if using `yarn`:

   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

   This serves the files in `dist` locally, useful for testing the production build.
